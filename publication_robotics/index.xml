      <title>Path Planning in Ellipsoidal Configuration Space using Silhouette method</title>

      <description>Abstract. This work presents the methodology used for implementing Silhouette method for Robot motion planning in Configuration spaces in arbitrary dimensions. A collection of ellipsoids are used to design and implement this Configuration Space of the robot. The path is then designed based on the Silhouette method as described by Canny [2], which creates semi-free paths in the configuration space and is complete. Djikstraâ€™s algorithm is used to connect the paths obtained.</description>

      <title>Using Programming by Demonstration and Dynamical Systems for Robot Learning</title>

      <description>Abstract. This work presents the methodology used for implementing programming by demonstration methods on a Universal Robot UR10. We used non-linear time-invariant Dynamical Systems that can imitate unconventional forms of motion. Gaussian Mixture Models were used to model input data and parameters of DS were optimized based on MSE and Log-likelihood cost functions. We incorporated a Kinect to detect users and ensure safety. Our system learns any non-circular path within three manual demonstrations and was spatially asymptotically stable.</description>
