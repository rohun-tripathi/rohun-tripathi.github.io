abstract: This work presents the methodology used for implementing Silhouette method for Robot motion planning in Configuration spaces in arbitrary dimensions. A collection of ellipsoids are used to design and implement this Configuration Space of the robot. The path is then designed based on the Silhouette method as described by Canny [2], which creates semi-free paths in the configuration space and is complete. Djikstraâ€™s algorithm is used to connect the paths obtained. This report introduces each of the key areas of the project and follows a step by step implementation of each. To conclude, we discuss the model output by our implementation and future directions of this project.
