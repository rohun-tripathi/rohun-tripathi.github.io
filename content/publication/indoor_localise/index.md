abstract: Location based services inside smart buildings are dependent on scalable localization methods. However, for enterprises, privacy of individual employees is a major concern. In this paper, we present a privacy aware occupancy sensing mechanism for large scale enterprises with multiple floors in multiple buildings of multiple cities. This is achieved through Wi-Fi fingerprint based localization methods implemented on edge devices. We present some preliminary results on occupancy sensing from our pilot study inside the office spaces of IBM India.
