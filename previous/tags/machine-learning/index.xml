      <description>Abstract. Location based services inside smart buildings are dependent on scalable localization methods. However, for enterprises, privacy of individual employees is a major concern. In this paper, we present a privacy aware occupancy sensing mechanism for large scale enterprises with multiple floors in multiple buildings of multiple cities. This is achieved through Wi-Fi fingerprint based localization methods implemented on edge devices. We present some preliminary results on occupancy sensing from our pilot study inside the office spaces of IBM India.</description>

      <title>Using Programming by Demonstration and Dynamical Systems for Robot Learning</title>

      <description>Abstract. This work presents the methodology used for implementing programming by demonstration methods on a Universal Robot UR10. We used non-linear time-invariant Dynamical Systems that can imitate unconventional forms of motion. Gaussian Mixture Models were used to model input data and parameters of DS were optimized based on MSE and Log-likelihood cost functions. We incorporated a Kinect to detect users and ensure safety. Our system learns any non-circular path within three manual demonstrations and was spatially asymptotically stable.</description>
